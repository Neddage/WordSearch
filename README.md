# WordSearch

A Python module to generate and score word searches. This module is designed to help users create custom word search puzzles, as well as provide a solution for scoring module generated puzzles. The module can be used independently or integrated into a larger application focused on learning and practicing spelling/literacy skills.

## Features

* Generate custom word search puzzles based on user-supplied words or predefined lists.
* Supports various grid sizes and word directions (horizontal and vertical only at present).

## To Do
* Score existing word search puzzles generated by the module.
* Implement more "WordPlacers" for adding words diagonally, reverse etc.
* Allow overlapping words in the grid.
* Easily adjustable difficulty levels to cater to different users' skill sets.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pip install git+https://github.com/Neddage/WordSearch.git
```

## Usage

```python
from word_search import WordSearch, HorizontalWordPlacer, VerticalWordPlacer
import random

# Create a WordSearch 20 x 20 letters
ws = WordSearch(20, 20)

# Get an instance  HorizontalWordPlacer
horizontalPlacer = HorizontalWordPlacer()
verticalPlacer = VerticalWordPlacer()
# A list of some words to add
words = [
    "this",
    "is",
    "an",
    "example"
]

# Add each word using the placer
for word in words:
    # Randomly use either horizontal or vertical placements
    if bool(random.randint(0,1)):
        horizontalPlacer.add_word(word, ws)
    else:
        verticalPlacer.add_word(word, ws)

# Dump out the grid
for row in ws.grid:
    print(row)

```

# WordSearch

A Python module to generate and solve word searches. This module is designed to help users create custom word search puzzles, as well as provide a solution for solving auto-generated or user-provided puzzles (eventually). The module can be used independently or integrated into a larger application focused on learning and practicing spelling/literacy skills.

## Features

* Generate custom word search puzzles based on user-supplied words or predefined lists.
* Supports various grid sizes and word directions (horizontal only at present).

## TODO
* Solve existing word search puzzles automatically, either generated by the module or manually created.
* Implement more "WordPlacers" for adding words vertically, diagonally, reverse etc.
* Allow overlapping words in the grid.
* Easily adjustable difficulty levels to cater to different users' skill sets.

## About

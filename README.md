# WordSearch

A Python module to generate and score word searches. This module is designed to help users create custom word search puzzles, as well as provide a solution for scoring module generated puzzles. The module can be used independently or integrated into a larger application focused on learning and practicing spelling/literacy skills.

## Features

* Generate custom word search puzzles based on user-supplied words or predefined lists.
* Supports various grid sizes and word directions (horizontal only at present).

## To Do
* Score existing word search puzzles generated by the module.
* Implement more "WordPlacers" for adding words vertically, diagonally, reverse etc.
* Allow overlapping words in the grid.
* Easily adjustable difficulty levels to cater to different users' skill sets.

## Usage

```python
from word_search import WordSearch, HorizontalWordPlacer

# Create a WordSearch 20 x 20 letters
ws = WordSearch(20, 20)

# Get an instance  HorizontalWordPlacer
placer = HorizontalWordPlacer()

# A list of some words to add
words = [
    "this",
    "is",
    "an",
    "example"
]

# Add each word using the placer
for word in words:
    placer.add_word(word, ws)

# Dump out the grid
print(ws.grid)

```
